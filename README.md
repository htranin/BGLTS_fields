# Investigating on the best selection of BlackGEM Local Transient Survey fields.

The notebook loads a galaxy catalog, selects starforming galaxies, computes the total stellar mass and star formation rate per field, and the number of past ZTF or TNS transients per BG field.

It allows the user to define thresholds to select BGLT fields. 

It includes a visualization of the selected fields and their galaxies.
